When I awoke I felt the call to go
Those places that I never thought I`d go
I spent the time to see which way to walk
But now that road just crumbles as i talk

So don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams
They'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go
Don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams
They'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go
